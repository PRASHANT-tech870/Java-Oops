        compile time -> method overloading (choosing constructor while creating an object)
         runtime -> dynamic -> method overriding (function overriding of parent class by child class)

         upcasting
         dynamic method dispatch
         early binding/late binding

         if class is final all the methods are also final
         final in class doesn't allow to inherit
         static methods cant be overridden because they are not dependent on the objects (but overriding depends on objects)

         Abstraction is solving a design level issue and encapsulation is solving implementation level issue

         encapsulation -> putting everything under a class, hiding data by using getters and setters
         abstraction ->   abstract classes and interfaces

         data hiding -> focus on security
         encapsulation  -> focus on simplification

         data hiding is achieved via encapsulation
         encapsulation is a subprocess of data hiding
